## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## üéØ Objective

WebEasy solves the problem of making complex information on the internet easier to understand, instantly.
Instead of forcing users to copy confusing text and search for explanations, WebEasy lets them highlight any text and get a simple, AI-generated explanation right there on the page.

It serves students, researchers, professionals, and everyday readers who come across complicated articles, academic papers, technical blogs, or legal documents ‚Äî and want quick, easy-to-understand clarifications without interrupting their flow.

While reading an article full of jargon, a user can just select any confusing sentence, click "Ask WebEasy", and immediately see a simple, friendly explanation ‚Äî no need to open a new tab or search manually.

## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
Pixels

### Team Members:  
- Aditya Sutar (![github](https://github.com/aditya-sutar-45) / ![linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya9sutar/) / Frontend)  
- Sushant Kumbhar (![github](https://github.com/TheSushantKumbhar) / ![linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushant-kumbhar-98458b275/) / Backend)  


### Your Approach:  
- We wanted to make the web more accessible, beginner-friendly, and fast to understand ‚Äî especially for students and curious learners.
Instead of making people leave the page to "Google" confusing terms, WebEasy brings simple explanations directly to them.

- Key challenges you addressed  
    - Real-time selection detection: Detecting when a user selects text and giving them a smooth, non-intrusive "Ask WebEasy" button.

    - Seamless user experience: Making sure the AI explanations appear naturally, without opening a ton of new tabs or making users lose their place.

    - Extension architecture: Managing communication between the content script, background service worker, and the React popup without breaking Chrome extension rules (like not using imports in service workers).

- Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking  
    - Initially, we thought of showing the explanation inside a separate popup window. But we pivoted to displaying the explanation directly near the selected text, because it felt faster, more natural, and kept users focused on the page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
    - React.js (Vite) for building the popup interface
    - Plain JavaScript for the content script (detecting text selection, creating the "Ask WebEasy" button)

**Backend:**
    - Flask (Python) API for processing and simplifying the selected text using an LLM (Llama 3)

**Browser Extension:**
    - Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
    - Background Service Worker for handling API calls
    - Content Script for injecting and interacting with web pages

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
